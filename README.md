# unlockZip

In progress!

To be used for those of us who created a password on a zip-file years ago, and now we've forgot the password combination, even if we know what's in the password.

* Add all your own common used passwords and let python create all possible combinations
* Use Linux bash to try unlock the zip file by using all different combinations generated with python
